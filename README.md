Greenhouse Detection with YOLOv5_Obb
This repository contains code for detecting greenhouses within a designated map area using YOLOv5_Obb, which supports oriented bounding boxes. The project aims to accurately identify greenhouses based on their specific shapes and locations.

Features:
Implementation of YOLOv5_Obb for greenhouse detection.
Detection within specified map areas.
Oriented bounding boxes for precise localization.
